# Auto Commiter
This is a shell script application which allows the user to add, commit and push to a github repo with just a word.

## Installation
- Inside the root directory place the `.bashrc` file.
- On the same location of the root with the `.bashrc` file, paste the `gitcommit.sh` file.
- You're good to go!

## Usage 
Simply on the preferred repo directory, open the terminal and type in `commit` to run the program. It will prompt for a commit description and once it's entered it will push automatically.
